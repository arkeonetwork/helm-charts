# Leveraging a checkpoint for the beacon chain will use less disk space and reduce sync
# time for the beacon chain to a few minutes (geth may still take hours or days). One
# provider list is found at https://eth-clients.github.io/checkpoint-sync-endpoints -
# you may select one from there or another source if desired. If you leverage a sync
# checkpoint it is important to note that the provider becomes a trusted party and
# should be verified by running `make verify-ethereum` after beacon sync shows 100%.
